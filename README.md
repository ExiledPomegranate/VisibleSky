A Fabric CraftMine (Minecraft April Fools 2025) mod that makes the sky block easily visible.

This mod doesn't do much, it just adds a few resource packs. Each resource pack adds a border around the sky block at a different opacity.
The number in each resource pack's name is the opacity percentage.

If you want one of the resource packs itself, all the resource packs are located in src/client/resources/resourcepacks

If you want to set a custom border width, color, or opacity, download a resource pack from the path above, open it, go to assets/minecraft/shaders/core, open sky_block.fsh, and modify the borderWidth and borderColor variables. After that, save the file and put the folder in minecraft's resource pack folder. If you don't know how to do any part of that, you can ask ChatGPT for help. Just give it these instructions.
