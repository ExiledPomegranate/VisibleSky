A Fabric CraftMine (Minecraft April Fools 2025) mod that makes the sky block easily visible.

This mod doesn't do much, it just adds a few resource packs. Each resource pack adds a border around the sky block at a different opacity.
The number in each resource pack's name is the opacity percentage.
